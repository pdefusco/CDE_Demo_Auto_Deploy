# CDE Demo Auto Deploy

## Objective

This git repository hosts the automation for a CDE Demo that includes Spark, Airflow and Iceberg. The Demo is deployed and removed in your Virtual Cluster within minutes.

## Requirements

To deploy the demo via this automation you need:

* A CDE Virtual Cluster in CDP Public Cloud AWS (Azure coming soon).
* A working installation of Docker on your local machine.
* Basic knowledge of CDE, Python, Airflow, Iceberg and PySpark is recommended but not required. No code changes are required.


## Demo Content

The Demo includes an Airflow DAG orchestrating three Spark Jobs in CDE. The first Spark Job loads fresh data into a staging table. The second Spark Job executes an Iceberg Merge Into into the target table. Finally, the third job performs some basic monitoring queries on Iceberg Metadata.

The Airflow Job is designed to run every five minutes independently. At each run new random data is generated, then added to the staging table and finally loaded into the target table. The same target table is used so if left running the demo can show what happens to Iceberg Metadata overtime.

Before the pipeline is executed, a setup job is launched upon triggering the deployment script. However, this job is not part of the demo track and is automatically removed when the setup is complete.

When the demo is deployed you will have the following in your CDE Virtual Cluster:

* Three CDE Spark Jobs: ```staging_table```, ```iceberg_mergeinto```, ```iceberg_metadata_queries```.
* One CDE Airflow Job: ```airflow_orchestration```.
* One CDE Files Resource: ```cde_demo_files```.
* One CDE Docker Runtime Resource: ```dex-spark-runtime-dbldatagen```.
* The CDE CLI is pre-installed in the Docker container.


## Deployment Instructions

The automation is provided in a Docker container. First, pull the docker container and run it:

```
docker pull pauldefusco/cde_demo_auto_deploy
docker run -it pauldefusco/cde_demo_auto_deploy
```

You will be automatically logged into the container as ```cdeuser```. Run the remaining commands from the container.

Add your CDE Virtual Cluster to the CDE CLI configuration file. To do so, paste your CDE Virtual Cluster's Jobs API URL at line 2.

```
vi ~/.cde/config.yaml
```

Next open the Airflow DAG and edit the username at line 50. Put your CDP Workload User here.

#### 1. Important Information

* Each generated Iceberg Table, CDE Job and Resource will be prefixed with your CDP Workload Username. Multiple users can deploy the demo in the same CDE Virtual Cluster as long as they use different credentials.
* Each user can deploy the demo at most once in the same CDE Virtual Cluster.
* All CDE Jobs and Resources are deleted from the CDE Virtual Cluster upon execution of the "autodestroy.sh" script.
* Currently Deployment is limited to AWS CDE Services but Azure and Private Cloud will be added soon.
* The entire pipeline is executed upon deployment. No jobs need to be manually triggered upon deployment.
* **Known limitation**: when the pipeline is deployed for the first time the DAG is run twice. Therefore, in the very first run you will see a duplicate job in the Job Runs page.

#### 2. autodeploy.sh

Run the autodeploy script with:

```
./autodeploy.sh dockerusername cdpworkloaduser
```

Before running this be prepared to enter your Docker credentials in the terminal. Then, you can follow progress in the terminal output. The pipeline should deploy within three minutes. When setup is complete navigate to the CDE UI and validate that the demo has been deployed. By now the setup_job should have completed and the airflow_orchestration job should already be in process.

#### 3. autodestroy.sh

When you are done run this script to tear down the pipeline:

```
./autodestroy.sh cdpworkloaduser
```

The script can also be run when the "autodeploy" script is still in process. It will stop and completely destroy the CDE Resources and Jobs deployed until then.


## Summary

You can deploy an end to end CDE Demo with the provided automation. The demo executes a small ETL pipeline including Iceberg, Spark and Airflow.
